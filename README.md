How to build
--------
Building this application can be done using Gradle. If you don't have Gradle installed, you can use the Gradle Wrapper.

To launch Gradle from Unix-like platforms:
```
    ./gradlew
```
To launch Gradle from Windows:
```
    gradlew.bat
```

The following tasks can be used:
```
    gradle build        # Performs a full build
    gradle compileJava  # Compiles production Java source files using javac
    gradle check        # Performs all verification tasks in the project
```
For more tasks, run `gradle tasks`.
